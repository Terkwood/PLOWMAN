# PLOWMAN

![PLOWMAN screenshot](/doc/screenshot.png)

A procedural farming game inspired by [Piers Plowman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Plowman).

🚧 *PROCEED WITH CAUTION* 🚧

🏗 *PROJECT UNDER CONSTRUCTION*  🏗

# Overview

> In a summer season when the sun shone softly
>
> I wrapped myself in woolens as if I were a sheep;
>
> In a hermit's habit, unholy in his works,
>
> I went out into the world to hear wonders
>
> And to see many strange and seldom-known things.

The dreamer will seek, among other things, the allegorical characters Dowel ("Do-Well"), Dobet ("Do-Better"), and Dobest ("Do-Best").

Grow crops in a procedural world. Earn rewards for undertaking wholesome actions. Barter with nearby civilians.

If you do too much evil, the adventure ends.

In "the real world", specific interactions, item placement, and NPC spawns should be randomized.

Dreams which tell the story of Piers Plowman are scripted by hand.

## Running the game

You can run the game using Godot engine, version 3.1+.

Binaries for various systems are made available on the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Terkwood/PLOWMAN/releases).
