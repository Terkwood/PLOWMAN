![PLOWMAN screenshot](/doc/screenshot.png)

A procedural farming game inspired by [Piers Plowman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Plowman).

🚧 *PROCEED WITH CAUTION* 🚧

🏗 *PROJECT UNDER CONSTRUCTION*  🏗

# Overview

> In a summer season when the sun shone softly
>
> I wrapped myself in woolens as if I were a sheep;
>
> In a hermit's habit, unholy in his works,
>
> I went out into the world to hear wonders
>
> And to see many strange and seldom-known things.

The dreamer will seek, among other things, the allegorical characters Dowel ("Do-Well"), Dobet ("Do-Better"), and Dobest ("Do-Best").

Grow crops in a procedural world. Earn rewards for undertaking wholesome actions. Barter with nearby civilians.

If you do too much evil, the adventure ends.

In "the real world", specific interactions, item placement, and NPC spawns should be randomized.

Dreams which tell the story of Piers Plowman are scripted by hand.

## Running the game

You can run the game using Godot engine, version 3.1+.

There are also limited-issue binaries available (expiring ~Apr 2 2019, first come first serve):

- Mac OS X: http://tinyurl.com/plowman-0326-mac
- Windows 64-bit: http://tinyurl.com/plowman-0326-win
- Linux 64-bit: http://tinyurl.com/plowman-0326-linux

## Procedural Farming

Imitating functionality from Stardew Valley is probably a good idea.  We'd like to embrace a procedural component, but implementing something like battles and fighting doesn't make a lot of sense, based on the content of the text.

## Randomization of NPCs

It would be nice to be able to assemble the look and feel of NPCs randomly.  Liberated Pixel Cup collections give a lot of examples of hair, clothing, etc, which should fit base character sprites.
