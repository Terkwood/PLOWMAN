# PLOWMAN

A pixel art game inspired by Piers Plowman

# Mechanics

The dreamer will seek, among other things, the allegorical characters Dowel ("Do-Well"), Dobet ("Do-Better"), and Dobest ("Do-Best"). 

Score points for undertaking wholesome actions. If you do enough evil, the adventure ends. 

One life. 

Specific interactions, item placement, dungeons, and NPC spawns should be randomized. Cutscenes are not randomized. Important NPC interactions are scripted. World map is not randomized. 

## Setup

Randomly pick sex and skin tone of hero. But initial clothing should be a gray hermit's robe. 

## Tiled Map Intergration

We need Tiled Map Editor integration for cutscene management.
