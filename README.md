# Overview

> In a summer season when the sun shone softly
>
> I wrapped myself in woolens as if I were a sheep;
>
> In a hermit's habit, unholy in his works,
>
> I went out into the world to hear wonders
>
> And to see many strange and seldom-known things.

The dreamer will seek, among other things, the allegorical characters Dowel ("Do-Well"), Dobet ("Do-Better"), and Dobest ("Do-Best").

Score points for undertaking wholesome actions. If you do enough evil, the adventure ends.

Specific interactions, item placement, dungeons, and NPC spawns should be randomized. Cutscenes are not randomized. Important NPC interactions are scripted. World map is not randomized. 

## Setup

Initial clothing should be a hermit's robe (gray/brown/etc).

## Controls

Favor gamepad input first. Keyboard as a fallback. Eschew touch enabled devices.

## Procedural Farming

Cloning functionality from Farmville is probably a good idea.  We'd like to embrace a procedural component, but implementing something like battles and fighting doesn't make a lot of sense, based on the content of the text.

## Tiled Map Intergration

We need Tiled Map Editor integration for cutscene management.

## Randomization of NPCs

It would be nice to be able to assemble the look and feel of NPCs randomly.  Liberated Pixel Cup collections give a lot of examples of hair, clothing, etc, which should fit base character sprites.
